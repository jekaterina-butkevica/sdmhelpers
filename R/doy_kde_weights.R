#' Calculate Day-of-Year Phenology Weights Using Circular Kernel Density
#'
#' Estimates a seasonal activity-density curve from a set of reference dates
#' and assigns phenological weights to another set of dates. Seasonality is
#' represented by day of year and estimated using a circular approximation to
#' kernel density estimation.
#'
#' @description
#' `doy_kde_weights()` converts `A_dates` and `B_dates` to day of year. A kernel
#' density curve is then estimated from `A_dates`, which are interpreted as
#' reference activity, occurrence, or phenology dates. The density of this
#' reference distribution is evaluated at each date in `B_dates`.
#'
#' Circularity is approximated by repeating the reference day-of-year values
#' one seasonal cycle before and after the original observations. This reduces
#' boundary effects between the end and beginning of the year.
#'
#' The density values associated with `B_dates` can be transformed to weights
#' using either:
#'
#'   - `"minmax_A"`: Min-max scaling relative to the complete reference density curve.
#'     The minimum density along the curve is assigned a weight of zero and
#'     the maximum density is assigned a weight of one.
#'
#'   - `"percentile_A"`: he empirical percentile rank of each density-at-`B_dates` value among
#'     all values of the reference density curve. Larger values therefore
#'     indicate dates occurring during relatively high-density portions of the
#'     estimated reference phenology.
#'
#'
#' The resulting weights may be used as relative measures of seasonal
#' availability, sampling relevance, or phenological correspondence. For
#' example, they may be supplied as observation weights in a subsequent
#' spatial kernel-density or sampling-effort analysis.
#'
#' @param A_dates A non-empty vector of reference dates representing the
#'   activity or phenological distribution from which the seasonal density
#'   curve is estimated. Values must be coercible to class \code{"Date"} by
#'   [as.Date()]. Missing or invalid dates are not allowed.
#'
#' @param B_dates A non-empty vector of dates for which phenological weights
#'   are required. Values must be coercible to class \code{"Date"} by
#'   [as.Date()]. Missing or invalid dates are not allowed.
#'
#' @param scale A character string specifying how the reference density values
#'   evaluated at `B_dates` are converted to weights. Must be one of
#'   `"minmax_A"` or `"percentile_A"`. Partial matching is supported through
#'   [match.arg()].
#'
#' @param n_days Either `NULL`, `365`, or `366`. Defines the length of the
#'   seasonal cycle used by the circular density calculation. When `NULL`,
#'   a 366-day cycle is used if any date in `A_dates` or `B_dates` falls on
#'   day 366; otherwise, a 365-day cycle is used.
#'
#'   Setting this argument explicitly can be useful when several datasets must
#'   be analysed using the same seasonal definition. Note that setting
#'   `n_days = 365` does not remove or remap observations occurring on day 366.
#'
#' @param bw Bandwidth passed to [stats::density()]. The default, `"nrd0"`,
#'   uses the corresponding automatic bandwidth-selection rule. A positive
#'   numeric bandwidth may be supplied to control the amount of seasonal
#'   smoothing directly. The bandwidth is expressed in day-of-year units.
#'
#' @param n Either `NULL` or an integer giving the number of equally spaced
#'   evaluation points used for the estimated density curve. When `NULL`,
#'   `n_days` points are used. Values smaller than 10 are not allowed.
#'
#'   Increasing `n` produces a more finely resolved density curve but does not
#'   add information beyond that contained in the input dates.
#'
#' @param eps A single numeric value in the interval
#'   \eqn{[0,\,0.5)}.
#'   Used only when `scale = "percentile_A"`.
#'   If `eps > 0`, percentile weights are clamped between
#'   `eps` and `1 - eps`.
#'   This prevents exact zero and one values before
#'   transformations such as the logit.
#'
#' @return
#' A named list containing:
#'
#'   - `weights_raw`: A numeric vector with one value per element of `B_dates`, containing the
#'     unscaled reference-density value evaluated at the corresponding day of
#'     year.
#'
#'   - `weights`: A numeric vector with one scaled phenological weight per element of
#'     `B_dates`. Values are on a zero-to-one scale, subject to clamping by
#'     `eps` when percentile scaling is used.
#'
#'   - `B_doy`: An integer vector containing the day of year derived from each element
#'     of `B_dates`.
#'
#'   - `density`: A list with numeric components `x` and `y`. Component `x` contains the
#'     day-of-year evaluation grid and component `y` contains the estimated
#'     density values derived from `A_dates`.
#'
#'   - `scale`: The scaling method used.
#'
#'   - `n_days`: The seasonal cycle length used in the calculation.
#'
#'
#' The order and length of `weights_raw`, `weights`, and `B_doy` correspond to
#' the order and length of `B_dates`.
#'
#' @details
#' Day of year is calculated as the zero-based `yday` component returned by
#' [as.POSIXlt()] plus one. Thus, January 1 is day 1 and December 31 is day 365
#' in a non-leap year or day 366 in a leap year.
#'
#' To approximate a circular density, the reference day-of-year vector
#' `A` is expanded to:
#'
#' \deqn{(A - D,\; A,\; A + D)}
#'
#' where `D` is `n_days`. A conventional one-dimensional kernel density is
#' then estimated over the interval from day 1 to day `D`. Repeating the
#' observations on both sides allows observations near the beginning of the
#' year to influence the density near the end of the year, and vice versa.
#'
#' The approach is a practical wrapped-data approximation rather than a
#' specialised circular probability-density estimator. Because three copies
#' of every reference observation are passed to [stats::density()], the
#' absolute magnitude of the returned density is affected by this
#' construction. The scaled weights remain useful for relative comparisons
#' within a result, but `weights_raw` should not be interpreted as a
#' conventional probability density integrating to one over the focal
#' day-of-year interval.
#'
#' With `"minmax_A"` scaling, weights are calculated as:
#'
#' \deqn{
#' w_i = \frac{f(B_i) - \min(f)}
#'            {\max(f) - \min(f)}
#' }
#'
#' where \eqn{f(B_i)} is the reference-density value at the day of year of the
#' \eqn{i}-th `B_dates` observation, and the minimum and maximum are calculated
#' over the full estimated reference curve.
#'
#' With `"percentile_A"` scaling, each weight is the proportion of values along
#' the estimated reference curve that are less than or equal to the
#' density-at-date value:
#'
#' \deqn{
#' w_i = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{j=1}^{m} I(f_j \leq f(B_i))
#' }
#'
#' where \eqn{m} is the number of density-grid points and
#' \eqn{\mathbf{1}\{\cdot\}} is the indicator function.
#'
#' This percentile is calculated over grid points rather than over the original
#' observations in `A_dates`. It therefore describes the relative position of
#' a date's density within the estimated annual density curve, not the
#' percentile rank of that date among the observed reference dates.
#'
#' Dates from different calendar years are pooled by day of year. Consequently,
#' the function estimates an average seasonal pattern and does not retain
#' interannual differences. In addition, calendar dates after February 28 are
#' shifted by one day in leap years relative to non-leap years because the
#' function uses literal calendar day of year. Users requiring a leap-day-free
#' or biologically standardised seasonal axis should preprocess their dates
#' before calling this function.
#'
#' @section Input validation:
#' Both date vectors must be present and non-empty. Conversion with [as.Date()]
#' must not produce missing values. The function also requires `n_days` to be
#' either 365 or 366 and `n` to be at least 10.
#'
#' For `"minmax_A"` scaling, the estimated density curve must have a finite,
#' non-degenerate range. An error is produced when its maximum is not greater
#' than its minimum.
#'
#' Validation of `eps` occurs only when `scale = "percentile_A"`, because this
#' argument is not used by min-max scaling.
#'
#' @section Bandwidth selection:
#' The bandwidth strongly affects the resulting weights. A small bandwidth
#' produces a more locally variable seasonal curve, whereas a large bandwidth
#' produces stronger smoothing across dates. Automatic bandwidth selection
#' provides a convenient default, but a biologically meaningful numeric
#' bandwidth may be preferable when the expected duration of an activity
#' period is known.
